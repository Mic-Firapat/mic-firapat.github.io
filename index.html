                <div class="subtitle">Master's Degree Possessor, Card Game Umpire, Gaming Enthusiast and Problems' foe.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It is fairly common for human's engines to use caffeine (also known as theine) as their main fuel.
                    This
                    is not the case for Ian Riviere's one, which has been powered by curiosity since he was able to
                    formulate an intelligible <span class="tooltip">question<sup>1</sup><span class="tooltiptext">which
                            was
                            before he could understand most answers.</span></span>. A strong desire to understand the
                    world
                    around him and the causes behind events (be it fortunate ones or less desirable ones) pushed him to
                    pursue scientific studies.</p>

                <p>Once one is able to grasp a better understanding of undesirable occurences and their sources, it is
                    but
                    natural to wish to save the day and rid the world of those. However, it is definitely funnier to
                    solve
                    problems caused by one's own incompetence with a keyboard and a plethora of transistors instead of
                    tackling some real problems like world hunger, pineapple on a pizza or global warming. That is the
                    reason why Ian spent great amounts of time fixing Segmentation Faults and Syntax Errors, acting as a
                    computer wizard in front of friends thanks to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)"
                        target="_blank">renowned penguin</a> and reading the remarkably precise error messages produced
                    by
                    MariaDB or MySQL's parsers while thanking GNU Bison for it.</p>

                <p>Now that Ian Rivere is finally endowed with public aknowledgement of his academical abilities in the
                    form
                    of a piece of paper named a <span class="tooltip">"Master's Degree"<sup>2</sup><span
                            class="tooltiptext"> in Data and Connected Systems</span></span> and somewhat capable of
                    dealing
                    with previously mentioned problems, he is eager to help companies by bringing in his natural
                    curiosity
                    and cheerfulness as well as his skills wrought during his academic curriculum, experiences in R&D
                    and
                    personal explorations. Do not be afraid of contacting him, it will be his pleasure to answer you
                    swiftly
                    and to take opportunities of tackling new problems and discovering new amazing technologies.</p>

                <p>You might also stumble accros Ian in collectible card game tournaments as a certified Judge, where he
                    willingly goes through the trouble of helping others have fun in a fair and competitive environment
                    while he himself is not allowed to play.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Ian and his friends have fun playing music quizzes available on YouTube. Unfortunately, it is hard to
                    find videos covering exactly the kind of content that this group of scoundrels affectionates. Hence,
                    Ian has developed a small project, which is not the most attractive in form but whose content is
                    functional.</p>

                <p>The audio files for the musics is downloaded downloaded automatically, as well as the image
                    representating the game (which is retrieved thanks to RAWG's API). The video itself is composed of
                    clips generated by a Pyhon Script, witch a normalised audio track.</p>

                </div>
                <p style="font-size:small">Note that the video probably has to be seen on YouTube, considering a lot of
                    tracks are
                    copyrighted, even though this is fair use.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Teaching and scientific vulgarisation are major points of interest for Ian, and it has been this way
                    before he even knew how to play Wonderwall by Oasis on the guitar. He likes to challenge himself
                    with mathematical problems and to help others solve them</p>

                <p>So, it was quite natural to be interested in how the content he enjoys is made, notably the videos of
                    the creator known under the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>.
                    During his leisure, he learns about the tools used in this field and continues to challenge is
                    reasoning skills.</p>

                <p style="font-size:small">It is recommended to watch these videos on Youtube or in full screen and to
                    pause them if they happen to be too fast (they definitely are).</p>
